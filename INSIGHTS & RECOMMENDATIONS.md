## 🎯 Project Summary

This project explores **Predictive Analytics for Employee Attrition** using a combination of **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Business Intelligence (BI)** tools. The goal is to help organizations proactively identify employees at risk of leaving—and to uncover the deeper business reasons behind attrition patterns.

The analysis was based on a structured dataset of **1,470 employees**, containing over **50 features**, including demographics, compensation, performance, job satisfaction, and behavioral data. Tools used: **Python (pandas, sklearn, XGBoost, SHAP)**, **SQL (SQLite3)**, and **Power BI** for live dashboards.

## 🔍 Key Insights from the Project

### 1. **Attrition Isn’t Random—It’s Patterned**
- 16.2% of employees exited, mostly concentrated in **younger, single, early-tenure segments**.
- Employees aged **18–25** and those with **<2 years at the company** churned at 25%+ rates.

### 2. **Overtime Is a Major Red Flag**
- Attrition rate for overtime workers: **30.5%** vs. 10.4% for others.
- Burnout risk is underestimated in current HR dashboards.

### 3. **Compensation Gaps Are Driving Exits**
- Leavers had a median monthly income **₹2,000+ lower** than stayers.
- Salary is the strongest modifiable variable for retention.

### 4. **Certain Roles Have Chronic Turnover**
- **Sales Representatives** (39.76%) and **Lab Technicians** (23.94%) face structural issues—low growth, high pressure, and undervaluation.

### 5. **Promotion Lags Hurt Morale**
- Employees without promotions for **5+ years** showed 22% attrition—even at senior levels.

### 6. **Frequent Travel and Long Commutes Compound Stress**
- Frequent business travelers and those with long commutes showed elevated risk—especially when paired with overtime.

## ✅ Actionable Insights for HR Leaders

### 🔹 1. **Establish a "First 24 Months" Retention Plan**
> Focus mentorship, goal-setting, and pay raises in the first two years—where attrition is highest.

### 🔹 2. **Audit and Regulate Overtime**
> Set max overtime thresholds. Create wellness triggers in HRMS dashboards when hours exceed a safe range.

### 🔹 3. **Increase Salaries in High-Churn Roles**
> Introduce tiered compensation upgrades in Sales and Technical roles based on attrition modeling.

### 🔹 4. **Implement Transparent Career Paths**
> Develop "Promotion Roadmaps" for each role and make them visible to employees. Set promotion checkpoints at 2, 3, and 5 years.

### 🔹 5. **Track Travel and Commute Metrics in Dashboards**
> Add these to employee records. Offer hybrid/remote options for frequent travelers or those commuting >10 miles.

### 🔹 6. **Use Predictive Modeling Proactively**
> Apply the trained **XGBoost model (86.4% accuracy)** to employee records monthly. Use SHAP explanations to interpret risk factors and intervene with retention strategies.
